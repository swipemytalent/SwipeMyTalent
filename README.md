# SwipeMyTalent 🚀
SwipeMyTalent is a community platform created by a freelancer, for freelancers.   
Born out of personal experience, it aims to break the isolation many freelancers face by offering a space for mutual support, collaboration, and growth.

## 💡 The Story Behind SwipeMyTalent
Like many new freelancers, I struggled:
- Discovery calls that turn into overpriced coaching
- Job applications that go unanswered
- Endless outreach with no results
- Personal projects that attract no one

Eventually, you start doubting yourself.  
Losing confidence and sometimes you’re forced to take a day job "just for now."  
Why are we all struggling alone?

Why not build a space where we can:
- Exchange services
- Expand our networks
- Get feedback and recommendations
- Gain visibility without breaking the bank

And that's how SwipeMyTalent was born.
